= file-leak-detector

== WTF is this?

This is a plain and simple leak detector for finding stream (and file descriptor) leaks in a Java application.

*NOTE:* Please refer `master` branch for an implementation covering newer Java versions (9 onwards).


== Why?

Leaving behind unclosed streams could cause great harm, especially if your application is long-running;
e.g. a web or application server that is supported to run indefinitely.
It could make you https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/462508/process-running-out-of-open-file-handles[run out of file descriptors],
exhaust your https://developer.adroitlogic.com/features/docs/17.07/file-store-feature.html#file-store-feature-2[file caches (we're big fans!)],
and in some cases, even https://developer.jboss.org/thread/54761[hang your process entirely].

Once we had been constantly fighting with file leaks in https://as2gateway.com/[our own SaaS AS2 exchange server].
And this tool, even in its primitive stage, helped us enormously.


== How does the leak detector work?

Almost all Java stream classes derive from one of two pairs of base classes:

* `java.io.FileInputStream` and `java.io.FileOutputStream`
* `java.io.FilterInputStream` and `java.io.FilterOutputStream`

By simply patching these two, we can get a global view of all stream openings and closings in your Java process. Simple.


== Patching the stream classes

The most straightforward way - which this project also follows - is to take the source of the core Java classes and insert our custom logic.

In our case we use a timer-driven detector. When the stream is created, it:

* captures the stacktrace of the current thread, which includes all classes and calls that led to the stream opening

* starts a timer that would fire after a predefined interval, printing this info into stdout or stderr

When `close()` is invoked, we cancel the timer (there's effectively no leak now).

If `close()` wasn't invoked within the stipulated time, we can suspect that the stream has leaked;
in that case the timer would fire automatically, and dump the stream identity (e.g. filename) and opener stacktrace.

Simple.

We can build a JAR with compiled copies of these classes, drop it into our application,
and sit back and relax while the detector does all the magic.

BUT...


== Loading the patched stream classes

This is a bit tricky (and might even be impossible, depending on your Java version).

`java.io` is one of the core Java packages, that gets loaded very early - while the JVM is still getting initialized.
Because of http://blog.ruwan.org/2012/12/dynamic-hot-swap-environment-inside.html?m=1#proposed_solution[Java's classloading policies],
there's no way to load our patched class later on and "replace" the originally loaded version.

So we use the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/standards/index.html[endorsed directories]
mechanism to prioritize our custom JAR over Java's native `rt.jar`.
When Java
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6644440/java-which-of-multiple-resources-on-classpath-jvm-takes[searches the classpath sequentially]
looking for `java.io.FileInputStream`, it will see our JAR before its own - and load our copy of the class.
It will https://coderanch.com/t/398654/java/Proving-class-loading-takes-place[not load the same class again],
so all streams opened in our JVM would go through our patched logic - and our leak detector.

```
java <params> -Djava.endorsed.dirs=path/to/your/JAR/or/its/containing/dir/ <more params> <classname, or -jar {JAR file}>
```

If the JAR was loaded successfully, you would see this printed to stdout/stderr about 1 second after the process was started:

```
LeakDumper [FILES,FILTERS]: 2000ms initial grace, 10000ms min-life
```

The endorsed directories mechanism was https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/release_changes.xml[deprecated in Java 8u40] and
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46419496/how-do-you-replace-endorsed-directory-in-java-9[completely removed in Java 9 onwards];
but you may be able to adapt
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28983922/alternative-for-deprecated-endorsed-standards-override-mechanism-and-extension-m#43812492[modules]
instead.


== Leak dump outputs

If it sees a suspiciously long-living open stream, the detector will dump something like this:

```
/tmp/prefix1879581817937119981suffix
id: 2 created: 1570066845396

  java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:45)
  x.y.Z.loadThatFile(Z.java:36)
  ...
  g.h.I.doThat(I.java:15)
  d.e.F.doThis(F.java:20)
  a.b.C.main(C.java:10)


```

This shows the chain of classes and method calls that led to the stream opening, which is almost always sufficient to identify the culprit.

* `id` is an incremental index - the number of streams monitored so far during this JVM session.
* `created` is the timestamp when the stream was opened


== Leak detect configurations

For convenience, the detector accepts the following parameters as environment variables, falling back to defaults if unspecified:

[cols="m,a,m",options="header"]
|===
|variable
|purpose
|default

|INITIAL_GRACE
|initial grace period (ms) to ignore detection, right after JVM startup;
without this, unnecessary streams (JVM- and framework-level (e.g. Spring) JAR/classloading etc.) may also be captured
|2000

|MIN_LIFE
|minimum lifetime (ms) of a stream for it to be considered as a leak, i.e. maximum time allowed for a stream to close normally
|10000

|DETECT_FILES
|whether to capture leaks for `FileInputStream` entities
|true

|DETECT_FILTERS
|whether to capture leaks for `FilterInputStream` entities
|true

|DUMP_STREAM
|to which standard output stream (`stdout`/`stderr`) the diagnostic information should be written
|stderr

|===


== Limitations

* The trick will not work on any JVMs where the class-load endorsing/whitelisting/prioritization is not supported

* The tool may produce false positives if the stream is closed via some means other than `close()`:
I'm not aware of any "other means" though.

* The tool would warn you, regardless of whether the stream is actually backed by system level resources
(e.g. in case of mock or in-memory streams/buffers a long-lived stream may not raise an issue).

* In some cases like long-lived TCP sockets, it may be acceptable to have the stream open for prolonged periods of time -
may not be a major concern because each stream is warned for exactly once.

* If your system or JVM is too busy, the timers may not get fired exactly on-time.

* Under heavy load with high-frequency stream ops, the tool may degrade performance
(console dumps; several extra objects being created for each opened stream; extra thread scheduling; etc.)

* Finally, worst case, under load, it could hang or crash your JVM entirely.
